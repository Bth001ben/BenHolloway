                Athens, Georgia is my home. I love it's diverse, creative, and inclusive atmosphere. Even so, I am open (and frankly a little excited) to relocate to a new city! I am passionate about fostering connections, deepening my understanding, and helping to create meaningful and lasting solutions.

                Sometimes I find myself looking back and wishing I had been aware of user experience when I was fresh outta high school trying to decide my major. (However) The more I think about it, the more I appreciate how my somewhat unconventional journey into the field of UX allowed me to grow as a person and develop skills that have become instrumental to my current work.

             <br>
             <p>
                 The older I get the less self conscious I become about being a huge nerd and the more I realize learning doesn’t have to take place in a classroom. Even though I left college early in favor of pursuing my passion for cooking as a career, I continued to seek to understand the world around me better.

             <p>
                 Whether it was telling riddles with friends, making substitutions in recipes, or even playing Zelda I have always enjoyed overcoming a challenge and creating a creative solution. During my time managing a board game cafe with a tiny snack kitchen I increased the business enough to necessitate hiring more kitchen staff which required redesigning the kitchen layout and workflow to facilitate the higher volume of orders we were receiving,

             </h2>
             <br>
             <p>
                 During my time working as a cook,  I found that I missed interacting with and helping people. I worked as a bartender and barista, as well as in retail sales and repairs. I discovered how much I enjoyed being just a small bit of joy in people’s day, by taking the time to listen and empathize with their problems.
